<h1>Production line simulation</h1>
<p>Discrete-time simulation of a factory-like production line in JavaScript and p5.js. 
	It supports multiple stations which can be linked serially, in paralell or in any 
	combination thereof. 
	In general terms this is an example of a <em>multi-stage producer-consumer pattern</em> 
	which potentially could yield an unpredictable outcome. 
	An alarm is fired when the system is completely jammed. 
	This occurs when all buffers are full. To see this effect, unccheck "Auto-remove output" 
	and wait until all buffers gets filled one by one. 
	The numerical and graphical representation of the overall productivity is shown on-screen.
	<em>Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed</em>.

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Some implementation details.</p>	
<ul>
	<li>The production line is implemented as a multi-level bi-directional linked list where each station is connected to the station that follows but also to the previous stations</li>
	<li>The input to a station is drawn directly from its input FIFO-buffer</li>
	<li>Configurable station throughput times, buffer sizes and failure probabilities</li>
	<li>Simulated station failures which affect the overall production rate</li>
	<li>During a station failure it cannot receive any input until the maintenance period is completed</li>
	<li>The visual output of the full production line is based on forward recursion</li>
	<li>Time-based update of the production line based on a recursive backward propagation algorithm</li>
	<li>Generates a realtime performance metric in terms of the overall production rate (number of produced items per time unit)</li>
</ul>
